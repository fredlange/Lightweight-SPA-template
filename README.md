# Lightweight-SPA-template (Early stages, use with caution)
Lightweight single page application using AngularJS and php. No database required.
This was created as a really rapid solution, its not to pretty, but works fairly good.

Goal is to rapidly deploy very simple websites as a single page application and no database dependancy.
The template does include a controller to use contact forms to send email, modular widgets to show repeated content and other stuff that is usually featured even on a simple website.
## How to use it
Just copy-paste the entire folder into root directory of the server. Add php-files to pages directory to create sub pages and add page content to files in pages directory. Edit configuration to add URL instructions to each page.

Edit main.php to create the html template and styles/style.css to make it look good.
